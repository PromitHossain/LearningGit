Hello. This is a dummy text document that I will be messing with to help me learn how to use Git without comprimising any valuable files.

I have added this second line after the commit that committed all files together for the first time.

Extra line is now added to demonstrate modifying a file within a new branch before merging it.

This line has been added via GitHub. Let us see if it will be visibile in the log once I make a commit.

This is a second line created in GitHub.

This line was created with the purpose of pushing it to the remote repository.
